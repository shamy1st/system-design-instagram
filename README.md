### What is Instagram?

  * Instagram is a social networking service which enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with other users.
  * Instagram users can choose to share information either publicly or privately.
  * Anything shared publicly can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared content can only be accessed by a specified set of people.
  * Instagram also enables its users to share through many other social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.
  * For the sake of this exercise, we plan to design a simpler version of Instagram, where a user can share photos and can also follow other users.
  * The ‘News Feed’ for each user will consist of top photos of all the people the user follows.
