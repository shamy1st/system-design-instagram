# Instagram Design

Design a photo-sharing service like Instagram, where users can upload photos to share them with other users.

Similar Services: Flickr, Picasa

Difficulty Level: Medium

### What is Instagram?

  * Instagram is a social networking service which enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with other users.
  * Instagram users can choose to share information either publicly or privately.
  * Anything shared publicly can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared content can only be accessed by a specified set of people.
  * Instagram also enables its users to share through many other social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.
  * For the sake of this exercise, we plan to design a simpler version of Instagram, where a user can share photos and can also follow other users.
  * The ‘News Feed’ for each user will consist of top photos of all the people the user follows.

### 1. Requirements

 * **Functional Requirements**
  1. Users should be able to upload/download/view photos.
  2. Users can perform searches based on photo/video titles.
  3. Users can follow other users.
  4. The system should be able to generate and display a user’s News Feed consisting of top photos from all the people the user follows.

 * **Non-functional Requirements**
  1. Our service needs to be highly available.
  2. The acceptable latency of the system is 200ms for News Feed generation.
  3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability), if a user doesn’t see a photo for a while; it should be fine.
  4. The system should be highly reliable; any uploaded photo or video should never be lost.

 * **Not in Scope**
  * Adding tags to photos, searching photos on tags, commenting on photos, tagging users to photos, who to follow, etc.
